                A renewable resource, also known as a flow resource, is a natural resource which will replenish to replace
                the portion depleted by usage and consumption, either through natural reproduction or other recurring processes 
                in a finite amount of time in a human time scale. When such recovery rate of resources is unlikely to ever exceed
                a human time scale, these are called perpetual resources. Renewable resources are a part of Earth's natural 
                environment and the largest components of its ecosphere. A positive life-cycle assessment is a key indicator of a
                resource's sustainability.
