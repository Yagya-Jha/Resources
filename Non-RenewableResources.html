        Non-renewable resource (also called a finite resource) is a natural resource that cannot be readily replaced by natural
        means at a pace quick enough to keep up with consumption. An example is carbon-based fossil fuels. The original
        organic matter, with the aid of heat and pressure, becomes a fuel such as oil or gas. Earth minerals and metal ores,
        fossil fuels (coal, petroleum, natural gas) and groundwater in certain aquifers are all considered non-renewable resources,
        though individual elements are always conserved (except in nuclear reactions).
